## Requirements (~$310)
1. [Raspberry Pi - ($65)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
This will be the brains of the picture frame. If you're looking to only display still images, you can get by with the 1GB version. Otherwise go with the 4GB version to show off animated artwork.


2. [SD Card - ($5.80)](https://amzn.to/356hBgg)
We'll load the Raspberry Pi operating system using this SD card.


3. [IPS Monitor - ($140)](https://amzn.to/2quRaBE)
An IPS monitor is great for displaying vivid images and looks great at any angle. You can display images for long periods of time without worrying about image burn-in. These portable monitors work well for the project because they're lightweight, thin, and can be powered via USB (ie. directly from your pi). Don't worry if the bevels are not uniform, we'll use the photo mat to cover everything but the screen.


4. External keyboard
A keyboard will be useful for initially configuring your Raspberry Pi's WIFI settings.

5. Cables
You'll need a power cable for your Raspberry Pi, a USB cable to power your monitor, and an HDMI to transmit video.  The IPS monitor will likely come with cables but I recommend getting some angled ribbon cables to fit flush against the frame.

  - [Monitor Power Cable - ($8)](https://amzn.to/36bFJhn)

  - [HDMI Cable - ($16)](https://amzn.to/2PoOEVZ)
You can find cheaper ones on AliExpress, but depending on where you're shipping to, it may take considerably longer.

6. Frame - ($20-$50)
This is where you can really personalize the project. Find a good 12"x16" frame that matches your style. Because these are standard frame dimensions, you can find them much cheaper than a custom built frame.

7. Photo mat - ($20)
The mat is an additional point of personalization and is used to hide the bevel of the monitor. Choose an acid-free material to prevent discoloration over time. To get the most real estate out of your monitor, you should custom cut the mat board (this is a service that most frame stores will provide). 

  - Outer dimensions: 12"x16"
  - Inner dimensions: 7.5"x13.25" (for the monitor linked above)

8. Foam board - ($10)
We'll use this to center the monitor in the frame and hold the Raspberry Pi in place. You can usually find these at a local frame supply store. Ask them to cut it into two 12"x16" rectangles.

9. [Exacto knife - ($2.50)](https://amzn.to/2LvKryw)
We'll use this for cutting the foam board to fit the monitor and Raspberry Pi.
